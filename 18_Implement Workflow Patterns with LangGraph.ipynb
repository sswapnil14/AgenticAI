    "In this lab, you'll master the three essential workflow patterns that transform individual AI models into sophisticated, coordinated systems. Through hands-on projects using LangGraph and LangChain, you'll build job application assistants, intelligent task routers, and multilingual processors that demonstrate real-world multi-agent coordination.\n",
    "These proven patterns - Sequential Agent Coordination, Intent-Based Routing, and Parallel Agent Execution - form the foundation of every enterprise AI system. By the end, you'll have the architectural knowledge to create AI applications that intelligently orchestrate multiple specialized agents to solve complex problems.\n"

    "Prompt Chaining is a workflow design pattern where complex tasks are decomposed into a sequence of LLM (Large Language Model) calls. Each step depends on the output of the previous one, allowing for step-by-step refinement or evolution of the data being processed. This method mirrors how humans tackle multifaceted problems—by breaking them down into manageable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "It leverages **function calling**, **sequential chaining** and or **AI Agents** , often implemented using frameworks such as **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, or even custom scripts. The key is modularity and clarity—each node (or step) has a specific role in the overall pipeline. Each link in the chain is a tool call or Agent the structure of which is something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical Structure:\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Initial LLM prompt (for example, generate a draft)\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Refinement prompt (for example, improve style, tone)\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Evaluation or formatting (for example, convert to specific format or assess quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern also allows injecting **external tools** between steps (for example, validation, summarization, keyword extraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Generating blog posts or marketing copy step-by-step (idea → outline → paragraph → polish)\n",

    "### Workflow Pattern: Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing is a pattern where an LLM (or small router agent) **classifies or interprets incoming input** and then **routes it to the appropriate sub-process** or agent. This design is helpful when you're dealing with **multiple types of tasks or user intents**, and you want specialized logic or handling for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works like a switchboard — one intelligent node (a classifier or router) analyzes the input and directs it to the correct branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- AI customer service bots (route billing, tech support, or general inquiries)\n",
    "- Multi-skill agents (for example, summarization, translation, and data extraction)\n",
    "- Adaptive education bots (route to math, science, or grammar modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Routing Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Hard-coded keyword-based routing** (primitive)\n",
    "2. **LLM-based routing** using classification prompts\n",
    "3. **Embedding-based semantic matching** with a routing map\n",

    "\n",
    "This pattern is useful when the system needs to handle **multiple types of tasks** based on the user’s intent. Instead of creating one large model to handle everything, we let a **router node** classify the request and direct it to a **specialized sub-process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If the input is “Summarize this article about AI,” the router sends it to the **summarizer**.\n",
    "- If the input is “Translate this to French,” it sends it to the **translator**.\n"

    "### Workflow Pattern: Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization is a pattern where **multiple LLM tasks are executed at the same time** instead of one after another. This is useful when different parts of the task can be done **independently**, allowing for faster processing and better system throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a kitchen where one chef is chopping vegetables, another is boiling pasta, and another is baking — all at once. None of them need to wait for the other to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI workflows, this means breaking a problem into parts and running them **in parallel**, then collecting and combining the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Summarizing different sections of a large document simultaneously\n",
    "- Translating a batch of user messages at once\n",
    "- Generating multiple variations of an ad copy or product description\n",
    "- Running safety checks using different prompts and comparing outputs\n",
    "- Ensembling results from different models or prompts for consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallelization Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Format Diversity (Multi-Output Tasks)**  \n",
    "   - Run the **same input** through **different prompt styles, languages, or output formats**  \n",
    "   - Each LLM call produces a distinct kind of result in parallel  \n",
    "   - Combine all outputs into a unified response  \n",
    "   - *Example:* Translate a sentence into French, Spanish, and Japanese at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Task Splitting (Sectioning)**  \n",
    "   - Divide a large input into smaller parts  \n",
    "   - Run each part through the same task (for example, summarization) in parallel  \n",
    "   - Merge the partial results for a final outcome  \n",
    "   - *Example:* Summarize each paragraph of an article simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consensus Voting (Multi-Agent Evaluation)**  \n",
    "   - Run the **same task** multiple times with different agents or prompt styles  \n",
    "   - Compare the responses and choose the best one via ranking or majority vote  \n",
    "   - *Example:* Ask 3 variations of a model to write a safe response and pick the most appropriate one\n"
