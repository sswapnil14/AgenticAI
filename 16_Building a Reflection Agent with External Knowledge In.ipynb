Organ meats are among the most condensed sources of essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, B12, iron, and zinc, which are highly bioavailable. This ensures optimal absorption compared to plant sources, which often contain antinutrients that hinder mineral absorption, like phytates and oxalates.\\n\\nEating beef or pork liver, for example, provides a superfood of sorts, delivering nutrients in forms readily accessible to the human body, aligning with our evolutionary diet. Additionally, incorporating high-quality animal fats and proteins supports hormonal health and satiation. This approach aligns with the 'carnivore cleansing protocol' that advocates for the elimination of plant-based antinutrients, which can disrupt gut integrity and metabolic functions.\\n\\nHumans evolved consuming animal products, including organ meats, which are notably richer in bioavailable nutrients than plant foods. The human digestive system appears optimized for animal-based foods; we possess simple stomachs with high acid production, facilitating the breakdown and absorption of nutrients from meat and organs.

Examples of these byproducts include phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins. [...] defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids.

      "{'answer': 'A nutrient-dense, clinically supported breakfast from an animal-based perspective includes organ meats such as liver, kidney, or heart, combined with eggs and high-quality meat or fish. Organ meats are rich in bioavailable vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, B12, iron, and zinc, which are more absorbable than plant sources due to the presence of antinutrients like phytates and oxalates that impair mineral absorption (Vermeersch et al., 2023; Prentice et al., 2024). The evolutionary evidence indicates humans evolved consuming nose-to-tail, with organ meats playing a central role in meeting metabolic demands. Additionally, animal fats and proteins support hormonal function and satiety, with human digestive physiology optimized for these foods. Human reliance on dietary fiber is unsubstantiated; our gut microbiome has adapted to nutrient-dense animal foods, and fiber can sometimes promote dysbiosis (Saladino et al., 2022). The consumption of plant antinutrients, including lectins and phytates, can provoke inflammation and gut permeability, counteracting health benefits (Lynch & Liu, 2021). A focus on organ meats and animal fats aligns with the evolutionary and biochemical evidence, optimizing nutrient bioavailability and minimizing potential toxins, thereby supporting metabolic flexibility and individual health responses.', 'reflection': {'missing': 'Specific mechanistic pathways regarding nutrient absorption and toxicity of plant antinutrients.', 'superfluous': 'General dietary advice without focus on mechanistic evidence.'}, 'search_queries': ['bioavailability of animal vs plant nutrients', 'human ancestry and organ meat consumption', 'plant antinutrients effects on human health'], 'references': ['[1] Vermeersch et al., 2023.
