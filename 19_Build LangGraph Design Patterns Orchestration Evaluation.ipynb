    "Estimated time needed: **30** minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll master two fundamental agentic design patterns that power modern AI workflows. You'll build a parallel meal planning system that coordinates multiple AI chefs, and an iterative investment advisor that refines recommendations through continuous feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world impact**: These patterns are used in production systems at leading companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, and Google—enabling AI agents to collaborate, self-improve, and tackle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks across domains from research to customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI systems take on more complex problems, a critical challenge arises:  \n",
    "**How can we coordinate multiple agents or components to work collaboratively, intelligently, and adaptively?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **LangGraph** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a framework for building **stateful, dynamic, and modular AI workflows**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional linear chains, LangGraph enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Iterative refinement**: Incorporate feedback loops and self-correction logic  \n",
    "- 🧵 **Conditional routing**: Dynamically choose different paths based on intermediate results  \n",
    "- ⚡️ **Parallel execution**: Process independent subtasks concurrently to boost efficiency  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Global state management**: Maintain and evolve shared context across complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, your workflows become more than just pipelines; they become **intelligent systems** capable of reasoning, adapting, and improving over time. This is **ideal** for use cases such as multi-agent collaboration, decision-making, evaluation loops, and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be loosely following [this](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#orchestrator-worker) LangGraph tutorial throughout this lab.\n",

    "# Orchestrator-Worker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-worker pattern is a powerful approach for handling complex, unpredictable tasks by dynamically **breaking them into manageable pieces** and **processing them in parallel**. When you can't predict upfront how many subtasks you'll need or what they'll involve, this pattern shines by intelligently **analyzing** the input, **decomposing** it into structured work units, and **assigning** specialized workers to handle each piece independently. This pattern is widely used in real-world AI workflow systems, including industry solutions such as IBM’s [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a busy catering kitchen that takes orders for large events—when a customer orders \"I want a three-course meal, hamburgers for lunch, and pizza for dinner,\" the head chef (orchestrator) analyzes the request and breaks it down into specific dishes, then assigns specialized culinary consultants to create detailed meal plans for each cuisine. Each consultant specializes in a specific cuisine, for example, one expert in Italian cuisine handles the pizza planning, while an American cuisine specialist develops the hamburger menu. The key is that each consultant receives a **clear, structured brief** with dish requirements and dietary considerations, not just \"plan something good.\" In our meal planning system, user requests such as \"feed my family for the week\" could result in anywhere from 3 to 15 different dishes, each requiring a specialist consultant's expertise in their particular cuisine to create comprehensive meal plans.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each node in the graph represents a **modular computation step**, such as planning, generating, evaluating, or synthesizing. The `StateGraph` defines how those nodes are connected and how data (state) flows between them. In a `StateGraph`, the input state travels through the workflow getting updated at each state, this is why the naming convention of the state remains consistent throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the graph** with a `State` schema that defines what information will persist and evolve across the workflow.\n",
    "2. **Add nodes** using `.add_node(name, function)`, where each node operates on a portion of the state.\n",
    "    - `orchestrator`, `chef_worker`, and `synthesizer`\n",
    "4. **Connect the nodes** using:\n",
    "   - `.add_edge(from_node, to_node)` for simple sequential steps\n",
    "   - `.add_conditional_edges(...)` for dynamic routing or parallel fan-out\n",
    "5. **Compile the graph** to finalize structure and validation.\n"

      "\n",
      "📝 Evaluator Feedback:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "The proposed investment strategy is classified as aggressive due to its heavy allocation towards high-growth equities (70% total), including a significant focus on small-cap growth and emerging markets, which are inherently volatile. While the strategy aims for a high target return of 15% annually, it prioritizes potential short-term gains over capital preservation, aligning with the investor's high-risk tolerance. However, the substantial exposure to equities and alternatives, coupled with reduced bond allocation, raises concerns about downside protection during market downturns, characteristic of aggressive investment approaches.\n",

      "**Revised Investment Strategy for High-Risk Tolerance Investor**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investor Profile Recap:**\n",
      "- **Age:** 29\n",
      "- **Salary:** $110,000\n",
      "- **Assets:** $40,000\n",
      "- **Goal:** Financial independence by age 45\n",
      "- **Risk Tolerance:** High\n",
      "- **Previous Strategy Grade:** Moderate\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evaluator Feedback Summary:**\n",
      "- The previous strategy is perceived as too conservative despite having significant equity exposure.\n",
      "- Need for a more aggressive allocation to align with the investor's high-risk tolerance and long-term financial independence goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**New Investment Strategy Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Return:** 15% annually  \n",
      "**Investment Horizon:** 16 years\n",
      "\n",
      "### Asset Allocation Plan:\n",
      "1. **Equities (70%)**\n",
      "   - **Growth Stocks (50%):** \n",
      "     - Focus on sectors with high growth potential such as technology (30%), healthcare innovation (10%), and consumer discretionary (10%).\n",
      "     - Consider small-cap growth ETFs to capture emerging opportunities.\n",
      "   - **International Equities (20%):** \n",
      "     - Allocate to emerging markets (10%) to take advantage of higher growth rates and diversification.\n",
      "     - Developed markets (10%) to balance risk.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Alternatives (20%)**\n",
      "   - **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) (10%):** Emphasize exposure to residential and commercial sectors that benefit from inflation and real asset appreciation.\n",
      "   - **Commodities (10%):** Allocate to a broad commodity ETF to hedge against inflation and provide diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bonds (10%)**\n",
      "   - **TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) (5%):** Provide inflation protection while maintaining some fixed income exposure.\n",
      "   - **High-Quality Corporate Bonds (5%):** Focus on a shorter duration to manage interest rate risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategic Adjustments:\n",
      "- **Increase Exposure to Growth Assets:** The allocation has moved from 30% in growth stocks to 50%, emphasizing a more aggressive stance on equities.\n",
      "- **Add Emerging Markets:** A dedicated 10% allocation to emerging markets enhances potential returns and geographical diversification.\n",
      "- **Reduce Bond Allocation:** The bond allocation is reduced to only 10%, focusing on TIPS and high-quality corporates to maintain some stability while prioritizing growth.\n",
      "- **Focus on Alternatives:** A significant 20% allocation to REITs and commodities to provide both income and inflation protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Regular Rebalancing:\n",
      "- **Quarterly Rebalancing:** Adjust the portfolio every quarter to ensure alignment with target allocations, capturing volatility and maximizing returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risk Management:\n",
      "- **Dynamic Allocation Based on Economic Conditions:** Monitor economic indicators and adjust allocations dynamically. For instance, if inflation rises, increase the allocation to TIPS and commodities. Conversely, if a deflationary environment emerges, look to bolster bond positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Simplified Execution:\n",
      "- **Core ETFs:** Utilize ETFs for all asset classes to simplify management and reduce costs. This includes growth ETFs, international market ETFs, REIT ETFs, and commodity ETFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "This revised strategy takes a significant shift towards a more aggressive investment style, focusing on growth and alternatives while minimizing exposure to traditional bonds. It aligns with the investor's high-risk tolerance and long-term goal of achieving financial independence by age 45 while targeting a 15% annual return. Regular rebalancing and dynamic adjustments based on macroeconomic conditions will further enhance the strategy's effectiveness.\n"

    "1. **Orchestrator–Worker Pattern**  \n",
    "   - High-level planning with an orchestrator node  \n",
    "   - Parallel task execution by independent worker nodes  \n",
    "   - Automatic state merging via `Annotated` fields\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reflection Pattern**  \n",
    "   - Iterative generate–evaluate loops inspired by real investor personas  \n",
    "   - Structured feedback using Pydantic output parsers  \n",
    "   - Conditional routing to refine or accept results until they meet targets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management & Routing**  \n",
    "   - A shared `State` schema carrying context across nodes  \n",
    "   - Flexible fan-out and conditional edges (`Send`, `add_conditional_edges`)  \n",
    "   - Loop control via iteration counters and routing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization & Testing**  \n",
    "   - Mermaid diagrams for graph structure inspection  \n",
    "   - Manual simulations and pretty-print utilities for debugging and presentation\n",

    "- **Check out [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018)**: AI Agents for business to automate and handle simple tasks using orchestration.\n",
    "- **Extend the Patterns**: Try the optimizer (plan–evaluate) pattern or combine reflection with reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Swap out the grocery-list or investment example for customer support, legal drafting, or robotic control.\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Instrument your graph with logging, latency tracking, and success/failure metrics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Robustness**: Add retry policies, fallback nodes, and alerting for production readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these design patterns—**orchestration**, **evaluation**, **reflection**, and **routing**—you can create truly **agentic systems** that plan, critique, adapt, and improve over time. \n",
